Participant 1

Background: Very casual gamer

	Wasn’t fully aware that the box had been successfully delivered, particularly in level 1:
		Disappears far away (box collector range too big)
		Didn’t find it obvious that the particle effect indicated successful delivery, thought that maybe box was destroyed for some reason
			It comes from the box, which makes it seem more like the box was destroyed
		No super obvious score increase

	Didn’t always interact with what they wanted to


	Suggestions:
	Level retry/select
	Respawning
	Would be good with a target score to reach

	Luke:
	Not sure why but levels were dark in build, like it was using the cel shading or lights were turned down, but it’s normal in the editor?

Participant 2 (Name is Josh, conducted by Ben)

	Had no major issues with any gameplay elements
	Had to figure out the controls (space to pick up), had the same problem with the large delivery vicinity
	“Instantly understandable - red goes in the red, blue goes in the blue…”
	Understood that getting hit by a vehicle was probably bad

	Suggestions: 
		The getting hit time was perhaps slightly too long


Participant 3

	Background: Non-gamer

	Observations:
		Could not complete without assistance
		Was not aware of game objective without instruction
		Was not aware of relationship between box colors and lorry colors
		Did not interact with hand trucks
		Was not able to clear forklifts after being initially hit 
		Player floats when close to some drop off points
		Drop off points hit boxes are too large

	Relevant Quotes:
		“I’m now trying to get into the tunnel” - when attempting to drop off package to wrong colored lorry
		“What are the lorries?” - was not aware that drop off points on edges of map were meant to be delivery lorries

Participant 4

	Background: Non-gamer

	Observations:
		Could not complete without assistance
		Was not aware of relationship between box colors and lorry colors
		Was not clear that the player was earning points for package drop off
		Not aware of time limit
		Game lockout when hit out of the level by truck
		Stuck on rails of High-Rise level
		Game crashes when clicking next level after High-Rise 

	Relevant Quotes:
		“I was concentrating so hard on everything in the level that I didn’t even notice the color of the trucks” 

Participant 5

	Background: Casual gamer

	Observations:
		Completed all levels without assistance
		Understood relationship between package, hand truck, and lorry colors
		Used hand trucks without instruction
		Was not aware that there were points or that there was a time limit, could not tell how much time was left
		Carrying and truck animations have defects
		Did not notice the camera shake when hit
		Not enough time to play the game, levels too short

	Relevant Quotes:
		“I reckon I would see the points better if they were displayed in the top right corner”  - with respect to delivery score
		“This seems impossible” - with respect to Uphill level, assumed character could not climb up to far side of level
		“It’s not clear how many points you need to proceed to the next level… and there is no method of retrying for a higher score”

Participant 6

	Background: Casual gamer

	Observations:
		Completed all levels without assistance
		Understood function of hand trucks without assistance

	Relevant Quotes:
		“The [numbers above the drop off bays] should be colored”
		“These goddamn forklifts and trucks go so fast”
		“This green grass is not good because it collides with the green lorry” 
		“Some of the drop off bays appear to be in shadow or its just not obvious that they are where the boxes need to be delivered”

Participant 7

	Background: Non-gamer

	Observations:
		Did not utilise throwing
		Was not clear that box was being successfully delivered
		Was thrown off by the differently size box collectors
		Felt there was not much progression between levels
		Did not find it obvious that hand truck colour had to match box colour to pick up

	Some minor bugs:
		Death sound playing multiple times at once?
		One time they died as the timer ended and the camera wouldn’t stop shaking in the end of level screen lol

Participant 8

	Background: Gamer

	Observations:
		Wanted tutorial
		Boxes disappeared too early on level1
		Expected boxes to be collected when thrown into truck
		Got locked in a loop getting knocked down by forklifts
		“Next” button on final level doesn’t do anything
		Wanted a way to change the volume
		
	Relevant Quotes:
		“The forklift hit me when I didn’t think I would get hit”
		“A retry level would be good”
		“I would prefer a key closer to WASD for throw”
		Levels are “basically just the same things but in different forms” - would be good to have another mechanic

Participant 9

	Background: Casual-gamer

	Observations:
		Ran out of time without achieving much on each level
		Thought the box got “lost” due to the large collection zones
		Didn’t realise you can deliver the boxes without the trolley
		Didn’t utilise throw mechanic
		Didn’t understand which path to take on level_highrise, and walked off the map

	Relevant quotes:
		“I thought the drones were stealing my boxes”

Participant 10

	Background: Non-gamer

	Note: is colourblind

	Observations:
		Struggled to differentiate the red and green boxes.
		Didn’t know if the drones were enemies
		Thought they were destroying the boxes on level1
		Sometimes didn’t notice all 3 trucks
		Didn’t realise the trolleys were colour coded to the boxes
		By the final level, seemed to have a better grasp of the game mechanics
		
	Relevant quotes:
		“It feels like I’ve hardly got started” in reference to the level timer
		“It makes it interesting having to dodge the lorries and forklifts”
